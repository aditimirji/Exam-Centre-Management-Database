The Exam Centre Management System is a comprehensive system that aims to streamline a university library operation, manage resources effectively and provide an interactive interface for users. This system aims to replace traditional methods with an efficient, user-friendly digital solution to simplify the day-to-day functioning of an exam centre. The Exam Management System project is a practical integration of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Software Engineering concepts, designed to address the real-world challenges of managing a library. The primary focus of this project is to create a software application that manages library operations, with an emphasis on database management through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The system will be developed as a web-based application that interacts with a relational database.
 
The objectives of the project are:
* Implement and manage a relational database for storing and retrieving information related to books, members, and transactions.
* Enable seamless creation, reading, updating, and deletion of database entries directly from the application interface.
* Provide functionalities for recording, issuing, and returning books.
* Create a user-friendly interface that simplifies interactions with the database for both library staff and members.
* Ensure the integrity and security of data through verified access controls.
